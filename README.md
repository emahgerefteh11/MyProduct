This is a personal project I am working on. 

The intent is to be an all-in-one place for infrastructure. From analyzing existing infrastructure, understanding the breakdown between platforms/products, analyzing and categorizing SKUs per platform/product, providing FinOps data, and finally being able to produce TF code to provision future builds. 

At this point in time, it is still a work in progress. Currently the only Cloud Service Provider that is covered is AWS. The plan is to do others once one full sweep is completed. 

AWS data is completely mock and generated by AI.
